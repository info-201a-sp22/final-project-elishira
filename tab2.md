# Analysis

In this chart, we take a look at the proportion of each activity organized and compared by age. The things we focused on were cigarette usage, alcohol usage, suicide, sex, weapon carrying, and physically fighting. For fighting, cigarette, alcohol, suicide, and sex, yes is 0 and no is 1, but for weapon carrying, yes is 1 and no is 0. What's most surprising about our findings is that 11 year olds tend to have numbers that rival 16 and 17 year olds. For example, the chart shows us that 28.6% of 11 year olds say they have had sex, while 29.4% of 17 year olds say they have had sex. ALong with this, 11 year olds almost always has a higher percentage saying yes than 12, 13, and 14 year olds. Another thing that's alarming is the percentage of teens who say they have attempted suicide. Most of them are pretty high, with 17 year olds reaching 48%. We as people must work towards lowering this number by a lot.
